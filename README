During years I wrote hundreds of small script for my own usage.
Some of these scripts may be useful for others.

calc
	quick calculator; supports args or stdin; interactive without args
extract-ebay-images
	store images of ebay items before the listing expires in N months
googlevideo-download
	download raw videos from now-obsolete yet active video.google.com
mingal
	create your hyperlinked image galery in a second
morse-encode
	be geeky, use Morse code
url-decode, url-encode
	process url-encoded or url-decoded strings

Best regards,
Mikhael Goikhman
